# Focus Backend Engineer Exercises

## Structure

## Async Exercise

Exercise is meant to be completed asynchronously and then brought to the follow up interview.  The exercise can be completed using any IDE, but this
repo includes settings for VSCode.

### Setup Instructions

1. Install python@3.9.7
2. Install [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#osx--linux--bashonwindows-install-instructions)
3. Run `poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true`
4. Run `poetry install --no-root`.  Installing the dependencies will take a few minutes.

### Exercise Instructions

2. Implement the `patch_employee`.  To verify that it's working as expected, all of the `TestPatchEmployee` tests should pass.
3. Implement the `post_application` API definition and implement the handler. To verify that it's working, all of the `TestPostApplication` tests shuold pass.
